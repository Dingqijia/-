Included in this paper are the created tongue classification dataset, the tongue segmentation model - UNet model and the tongue classification model - ResNet101 model
where train-images-idx3-ubyte and custom-labels.idx1-ubyte are the original images and corresponding labels included in the tongue classification dataset, both in idx format.
If we need to use the code in this paper for training, we need to convert images and labels to jpg files and txt files respectively.
The txt file contains the corresponding labels of the tongue classification dataset, which are represented by [0~31] in the label.
